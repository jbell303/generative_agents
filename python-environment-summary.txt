# Python Environment Summary

## Environment Setup

1. Downgraded from Python 3.13 to Python 3.10 by:
   - Installing Python 3.10 via Homebrew: `brew install python@3.10`
   - Creating a new virtual environment with Python 3.10: `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.10 -m venv venv`
   - Activating the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`

2. Upgraded core pip tools:
   - `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel`

3. Successfully installed all packages from original requirements.txt

## Compatibility Resolution

The key issue resolved by this downgrade was compatibility with older packages, particularly:
- `gensim==3.8.0` which had C extension compatibility problems with Python 3.13
- Other packages with outdated dependencies that were not compatible with Python 3.13

## Current Environment

- Python version: 3.10.17
- Virtual environment: Located in `./venv/`
- All required packages installed successfully

## Next Steps

1. The application should now work with all required dependencies.
2. If you need to install additional packages, use `pip install package_name`.
3. Remember to always activate the virtual environment before working on the project:
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. If you want to export the current environment's packages:
   ```
   pip freeze > requirements-frozen.txt
   ```
