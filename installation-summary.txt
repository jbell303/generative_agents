## Failed Installations
- gensim: C extension compatibility issues with Python 3.13

## Next Steps

1. Continue working with the installed packages which cover most ML needs.

2. For gensim functionality, consider:
   - Using other packages like spaCy for NLP tasks
   - Trying to install gensim from source with custom build options
   - Creating a separate conda environment with Python 3.10/3.11 if gensim is critical

3. For any other packages from the original requirements.txt, install them individually to test compatibility.

4. Check the application to verify it works with the current set of installed packages.

Note: Python 3.13 is a relatively new version, and some packages may not yet be fully compatible with it. If you encounter significant issues, consider downgrading to Python 3.10 or 3.11 which have better package compatibility.
